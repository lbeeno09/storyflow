## A Story Making Asistance Application

# Some Instructions

## My environment is currently used for nvim in windows, hence .clang-format and compile_flags.txt files. In the future, I'm going to make the project platform agnostic.

## Imgui I'm using uses freetype. Refer to the original repo's README or do the following:
1. Install freetype (current project uses vcpkg so that would be nice)
2. Add imgui_freetype files to the project.
3. change macro in imconfig.h

# Future TODOs
- Make project platform agnostic
